# Code
To reproduce **Fig.1** please run `distributedMTLSPCA.py`. You can change the parameter at the top of the file (n,p,proportion of data, etc.)

To reproduce **Fig.2** please run `addedTasks.py`. To only see theoretical performance for different task relatedness please refer to `addedTasksTheory.py`. The latter python program also brings a comparison with Bayes optimal error rate which proves the distributed MTL-SPCA to be information-theoretically optimal. This comparaison can be obtained by switching the `compare_with_bayes_optimal` to `true`.

To reproduce **Fig.3** please run `amazonReview.py`.

To reproduce **Fig.4** please run `officeCaltech.py`.
